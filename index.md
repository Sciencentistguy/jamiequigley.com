# About me

I'm a 3rd year computer science student at the [University of York](https://york.ac.uk). I'll be using this blog to occasionally write about whatever's on my mind, be that programming, my course, or anything else in the world.

I am currently Secretary of [CyberSoc](https://cybersoc.co.uk), the cybersecurity society at the university. We run workshops and talks about security and hacking.

You might want to take a look at my [github](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy), where I host all of my projects, including this website, which is available under the AGPL.

I am a Free Software advocate and enthusiast, and a hobbyist data archivist. I have a [gitea](https://git.quigley.xyz/explore/repos), where I mirror any git repositories that I have worked on, including those on my github and AUR packages I maintain, as well as other git repositories that I think are worth archiving.

# Contact me

If you want to contact me, the best way is probably by email. My address is `<jamie (at) quigley (dot) xyz>`. I am also on [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sciencentistguy), and matrix (`@jamie:matrix.quigley.xyz`).
