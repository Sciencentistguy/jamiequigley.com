Hi ðŸ‘‹! I'm Jamie (or Sciencentistguy)

I'm a Rust and C++ systems programmer and general computer enthusiast.

I spend my (non-work) time writing software, working on my collection of self-hosted services, and contributing to a range of open-source projects. I'm also a data archival nerd, and a contributor to the [musicbrainz](https://www.musicbrainz.org/) project.

At work, I write C++, for a distributed real-time cloud service.

I am a maintainer of the nixpkgs linux package repository, and use NixOS on all my linux systems (even this server!).

## Contact me

If you want to talk tech, have a question about one of my projects, or are just feeling particularly social and want a chat, feel free to reach out!

I can often be found lurking on libera.chat IRC, especially in `#musicbrainz`, `#nixos`, and `#haskell`.

I'm `@sciencentistguy` on discord, and of course you can email me at `jamie@quigley.xyz`.

I'm also on the usual social media (although I'm far more active on Twitter than anything else):

- [Twitter](https://twitter.com/Sciencentistguy)
- [Mastodon](https://tech.lgbt/@Sciencentistguy)
- [Cohost](https://cohost.org/sciencentistguy)

## Projects

Here are a few of the projects I'm most proud of. Check them out!

All my open-source projects are hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy). Here are a few I'm particularly proud of.

#### discord-channel-archiver

[discord-channel-archiver](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/discord-channel-archiver) is a discord bot that can export the contents of a discord channel and save it into multiple formats.

The highlight of this is the HTML output mode, which produces an HTML file that, when viewed in a browser, looks quite similar to Discord's interface.

#### videoconverter

[videoconverter](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/videoconverter) is a rust program that analyses the contents of media files, and then remuxes (or reencodes, if chosen) them to a standard container format, dropping unneeded audio and subtitle streams. Originally written to assist with archiving DVDs and Blu-Rays.

#### rust-nix-shell

[rust-nix-shell](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/rust-nix-shell) is a nix-based alternative to rustup, for spawning ephemeral nix-shells with a complete rust toolchain, of any specified version (a rust release channel, a named release, or a dated nightly).

#### rit

[rit](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/rit) is a git-compatible version control system, written in Rust. It is loosely based on jit, and the accompanying book [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/).
