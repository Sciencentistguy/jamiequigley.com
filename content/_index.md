# Jamie Quigley

Hi ðŸ‘‹!

I'm Jamie. I'm a recent graduate of an MEng degree in Computer Science from the University of York. This website is primarily a blog, which I will likely forget to write posts for ðŸ˜….

I'm interested in finding performant solutions to novel problems in many spaces, but I am specifically interested in systems programming using Rust and C++.

## Skills

### Programming

My primary programming languages are Rust and C++, however I am a proficient programmer in many other languages, including (in alphabetical order):

- Bash
- C
- Flux (the InfluxDB query language)
- Haskell
- Java
- Kotlin
- Nix
- Python
- Typescript

### Server administration

I am a maintainer of the nixpkgs linux package repository, and use NixOS on all my linux systems (where possible).

I also operate many servers for personal projects, and therefore have experience using many common server-side tools, primarily systemd and docker. I use a combination of systemd units (managed by NixOS) and docker containers to run services on my home server.

### Data management

I use prometheus, InfluxDB, and Grafana on my home server to aggregate and monitor telemetry from various services I run.

I have also written scrapers to export data from services and insert them into said databases, for visualisation

## Highlighted projects

All my open-source projects are hosted on my [Github](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy). Here are a few I'm particularly proud of.

### [discord-channel-archiver](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/discord-channel-archiver)

`discord-channel-archiver` is a discord bot that can export the contents of a discord channel and save it into multiple formats.

The highlight of this is the HTML output mode, which produces an HTML file that, when viewed in a browser, looks quite similar to discord's interface.

### [rust-nix-shell](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/rust-nix-shell)

`rust-nix-shell` is a nix-based alternative to rustup, for spawning ephemeral nix-shells with a complete rust toolchain, of any specified version (a rust release channel, a named release, or a dated nightly).

### [rit](https://github.com/Sciencentistguy/rit)

`rit` is a git-compatible version control system, written in Rust. It is loosely based on jit, and the accompanying book [Building Git](https://shop.jcoglan.com/building-git/).
